biography: |-
  I have been a hairstylist for over 50 years and a salon owner for 43 years.
  Owning a salon and working with a talented staff makes my job easy. My favorite part of my career is the relationships, and the ability to create and change not only the hair but give a new perspective to a client. Their happiness with how they look makes them feel more confident and can lift oneâ€™s spirits.
  Working with color has changed so much in the industry and it is fun to watch and see what might come next. I have always strived to a high standard of professionalism, with a warm friendly atmosphere. I believe I have achieved this goal and am very proud of the salon we have created.
