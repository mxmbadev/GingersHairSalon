  Hi!  I am Elizabeth and I have been styling hair since 1999.  I was raised here in middle Tennessee.  After becoming a hairstylist and living and working in Orlando FL and Franklin TN, I found my way home to Columbia with my husband and two boys.

  I specialize in lived in loose texture, dry hair cutting, and soft dimensional color.  I was taught to believe that hairdressing is an art!  Continuing education and always staying inspired are important to me.  My influence and inspiration come from my family, nature, quiet, theology, and music.
